# Programming Languages 1 (6th Semester)
### National and Technical University of Athens - School of Electrical and Computer Engineering
----------------
The purpose of this course is the understanding of the core fundamentals and concepts of Programmic Languages design. Some of the topics examined are:
* Syntactic Analysis
* Functional Programming
* Types and Type Inference
* Variable Scope
* Memory Management and Activation Records
* Object Oriented Programming
* Exceptions
* Parameter Passing
* Logical Programming
---
This repo is dedicated to the assignments of the course, in which we had to implement algorithms in the following programming languages:
* C++
* SML-NJ
* Java
* Prolog
---
Following up, we present the problems and the languages used for each one:
* Skitrip (C++, SML-NJ and Prolog)
    > Problem: Given a list of numbers, find the longest interval for which the left bound number is smaller than the right bound number.
* Spacedeli (C++ and SML-NJ)
    > Problem: Apply Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path and distance between two nodes. In this problem, the graph needed to have 2 levels and the weights of the edges were all equal to 1.
* Villages (SML-NJ and Java)
    > Problem: Apply Union-Find algorithm to count the groups of nodes in a graph.
* Moredeli (SML-NJ, Java and Prolog)
    > Problem: Apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path and distance between two nodes. In this problem, the graph had 1 level and the weights of the edges were not equal.
* Hopping (C++ and Prolog)
    > Problem: The problem supposes that we have a ladder with broken steps and a set $S$ of possible steps we can make. We have to find with how many different ways, one can climb that stair.
